### Roadmap

## Code

- an `enum` of possible item types could be added (and the UI could be enhanced based on knowing which item type is there)

## UX

- Individual items should have an icon to represent the item type on the order screen
- Cart should allow individual items to have their quantity increased or decreased
- Cart should allow individual item rows to be deleted
- User should be able to select quantity of item in lieu of clicking the add button a number of times

## UI

- A UI designer could make this app not ugly :)
